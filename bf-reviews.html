			"Fans of ... Adriana Trigiani will appreciate ... debut novelist, Rosanna Chiofalo. Her first book, Bella Fortuna, is an excellent readalike for Trigiani's Valentine series ... the author describes the magic and romance of this floating city - Venice - in a style that will make readers feel they are drifting on a gondola under the Bridge of Sighs. A warm,  life-affirming domestic drama about the faith and love of family and friends."<br><br> --
