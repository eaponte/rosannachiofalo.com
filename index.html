						<h3>Developmental Editing</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						Developmental editing serves to improve the content and structure of a manuscript and is usually the first step in the editing process.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a developmental editor, I'll provide feedback on big-picture issues. I'll take a look at plot, pacing, characterization, and setting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Throughout the process, ideas will be refined, the narrative will be shaped, and any major plot or character inconsistencies will be fixed.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want your manuscript to successfully complete the journey to becoming a professional, published book, developmental editing is your first step.

						<h3>Copyediting</h3>
					</div>
					<p>
						As a copyeditor, my job is to find any inconsistencies in your manuscript. In addition, I will make suggestions on improving the syntax so that your writing reads smoothly and shines in its best light. I will also look for grammatical and punctuation errors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Copyediting is often one of the final steps before publishing and serves to create the most readable version of your book.
					</p>
					<p>
						To this end, my goal is to make sure that every element of your story is consistent, cohesive, and complete. I'll accomplish this by bridging the gaps between the author's intent and the reader's understanding.

						Research has consistently shown that jacket copy ranks in the <strong>top 5 reasons</strong> of what motivates a buyer to purchase a book. According to a study conducted by <a class="link_2" href="http://www.publishingtrends.com/2009/05/jacket-copy-sells-books/" target="_blank">Publishing Trends</a>, jacket copy was the 2nd most important book purchase factor - falling only second behind favorite author!

						I have <strong>over 25 years of book publishing copywriting experience</strong> working for most of the major New York City publishing houses including Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, St. Martin's Press, Kensington Publishing, HarperCollins, and Harlequin.
					</p>
					<p>
						My experience includes writing copy for <em>New York Times</em> <strong>bestselling authors</strong> such as Janet Evanovich, Stephen Coonts, Sue Grafton, Wilbur Smith, Karin Slaughter, Lisa Jackson, Fern Michaels, Joanne Fluke, Brenda Jackson, Julia Quinn, and many more.

					<p>
						With all of the self-published authors in the market today, it's more important than ever to stand out among the crowd and have a professional help you with your back cover copy.

						Whatever your genre - romance, contemporary fiction, suspense thriller, literary fiction, mystery, sci-fi, fantasy, YA, nonfiction, or self-help.

						<em><strong>Rosanna Chiofalo returns with another evocative, beautifully written novel set against the stunning vistas of Tuscany...</strong></em>
					</p>
					<div class="text-left">
						<p>
							In the fields around Tuscany in summertime, sunflowers grow in profusionâ€”wave upon wave of gold and green standing tall against the Italian sky. But for Signora Maria Ferraro, the bright yellow blooms carry only bitter memories. Though she loved them as a child, sunflowers have come to represent the most painful episode of her life. Not even her cherished daughter, Anabella, knows what happened to her during World War II, when the Germans overran her hometown of Florence and Signora Ferraro fell in love with a Resistance fighter. In the aftermath of loss and grief she found salvation through an unlikely source-cultivating roses on her farm in the Tuscan countryside. Now the blossoms symbolize everything that is both good and safe, and she nurtures them with as much care as she guards her past.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yet to Anabella, the rose farm that once delighted her has become little more than a pretty prison. Despite her beautiful surroundings, Anabella longs for more. During one of her regular visits to Siena to sell their flowers, Anabella encounters a handsome young artist named Dante Galletti. His canvases are filled with images of a girl who looks just like Anabella-and Dante claims to have seen her in his dreams, running through a sunflower field. Through Dante, Anabella begins to see sunflowers, her cloistered existence, and the world itself through new eyes. As their relationship deepens, Anabella knows she will soon have to choose between loyalty to her mother, and the risks and rewards of living on her own terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Alternating between the viewpoints of both mother and daughter, and between Italy during World War II and a quarter-century later, The Sunflower Girl is a poignant and moving story of the choices we make in the name of love, and the secrets that echo through generations.

						I have 25+ years of book publishing experience, having worked both in-house and freelanced for Hachette Books, Harlequin Books, HarperCollins Publishing, Kensington Publishing, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, and St. Martin's Press. Whether you're looking to have your book edited, line edited, and/or proofread, need help writing and/or editing your online retailer book description and/or book jacket copy, I can help you achieve your goals.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it comes to editing and writing for my clients, one of my favorite experiences is the collaboration work as I help my clients develop and foster the vision they have for their books and other writing projects. The genres I specialize in are women's fiction and romance, but I have also worked on fiction, mysteries, suspense thrillers, memoirs, and general non-fiction. I am also a published author of six women's fiction novels, one of which was an e-book New York Times bestseller and a print USA Today bestseller.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an author, I understand the challenges that writers encounter with maintaining even story flow, building character development, adding a sense of intrigue and suspense so that readers will continue turning the pages, and ensuring that facts and details are consistent throughout the book. I can help you every step of the way. Furthermore, if you would like help with your online retailer book descriptions or book jacket copy, I have extensive experience in writing creative, fun, eye-catching copy that will immediately hook readers and make them want to buy your book NOW!
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's a little of what you can expect working with me. First, I will review your work, giving it a thorough read. I will then go through your manuscript and suggest necessary line edits to make your writing even stronger and improve your overall storytelling while ensuring I stay true to your written voice. I will also correct grammatical and punctuation errors. I will point out and query any inconsistencies, repetitions, or other details you might have missed. Once I'm done, I will provide a summary of my suggested edits. I will then send my edits to you for your review. Lastly, if you would like me to write your jacket copy or online book retailer description, I can provide two drafts of copy and we can work together on any revisions you'd like with the copy. Throughout the process, I encourage you to ask any questions or talk to me about any concerns you might have.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hope you will join me on the exciting journey of taking your writing to the next level!
