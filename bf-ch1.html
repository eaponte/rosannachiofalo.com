		<strong>Chapter 1 - Unlucky 13</strong>
	</div>
<p>
I've never considered myself very lucky. Maybe it has something
to do with my being born on Friday the 13th and one day shy of
Valentine's Day. For a long time, I've been convinced that my birth
date is the reason why I've been so cursed in love. And my being
named after the patron saint of love, St. Valentine, when I've had
nothing but agita in romance just makes it more painfully ironic.
Agita is what Italians call grief of the worst kind. To top it off, my
mother is very superstitious and believes in the dreaded malocchio,
or evil eye, even though it's 2010. Malocchio is when someone puts
a curse on you. And many Italians are fervent believers in the
mighty power of the malocchio. But none of that matters anymore
since I've finally met "the one."
</p>
<p>
Thinking about this and how my luck has changed, on this cold
Sunday morning, I walk out of church. January in New York City is
definitely not one of my favorite months. But as every New Yorker
knows, the frigid temps don't stop you. The streets are the quietest
on Sunday mornings, my favorite time to be walking through Asto-
ria, the Queens neighborhood where I grew up and still live.
</p>
<p>
The attendance at the eight a.m. Mass at Immaculate Concep-
tion is usually low-too early for most people to get up on the
weekend. Even though it's a drag to get myself out of bed, I still go 
through this weekly ritual. It's meditative for me. It's not often one
can go somewhere in New York City without running into a crowd
so you have to grab your quiet moments when you can. Sunday
mornings are when I can hear myself think best. Even though it's
just slightly above the freezing mark, I take my time walking home.
</p>
<p>
The shops that do open on Sundays are slowly coming to life.
Several joggers pass me on their way to Astoria Park. Dogs are trot-
ting along, immune to the nip in the air.
</p>
<p>
Anyone who knows me will tell you that I love to people-watch,
and New York City is a great place to do it. Probably nowhere else
in the world will you encounter as many people from different eth-
nic, socioeconomic, and religious backgrounds-well, except for at
an airport!
</p>
<p>
The aroma of fresh baked bread from the Italian bakeries
reaches my nose. Through the windows, I spy a few old men al-
ready sitting at the bakeries' tables, sipping their cappuccinos and
reading La Corriere della Sera newspaper. As I step through the
doors of Antoniella's Bakery, I spot Paulie Parlatone's S-shaped re-
ceding hairline behind his newspaper.
</p>
<p>
Paulie is known as "the Mayor of 35th Street" or "Il Sindaco" for
his meddling in everyone's affairs on my block. He has no idea he'd
been christened with this nickname, just as he has no idea that he
talks too much. The irony isn't lost on everyone that his last name,
"Parlatone," means "big talker" in Italian. Paulie will stop you in
the street and grill you to the point where you finally surrender and
tell him your personal business just so you can end the conversa-
tion more quickly.
</p>
<p>
The worst is when he shows up at your house unannounced. He
often comes to my home right after dinner, asks my mother for a
toothpick, and makes himself just as comfortable as if he's sitting in
his own house. While he talks to us, he picks his teeth with the
toothpick. And no matter how well you hide your dirty laundry,
nothing gets past Paulie.
</p>
<p>
I quickly walk by Paulie's table at Antoniella's, praying not to be
noticed.
</p>
<p>
"Valentina!"
I keep walking, pretending I can't hear amid the din in the 
crowded bakery. Already there's a line of customers, waiting to get
their Sunday Danish, croissants, and biscotti. I try to hide behind
the Shaquille O'Neal dead ringer who stands in front of me on line.
But not even the man's tall figure disguises me. A finger taps me on
the shoulder.
"Valentina! Didn't you hear me?"
"Ohhh, Paulie. I'm sorry. I'm a bit preoccupied, and with the
noise in here, I guess I didn't hear you." I give him a faint smile.
</p>
<p>
"Always thinking! That's been you since you were a little girl.
Remember the time you almost hit me while you were riding your
bike? You were staring right up at the clouds. I had to whistle to
get your attention."
</p>
<p>
Of course I remember that day. It's true, I did like to daydream
a lot as a kid. Sometimes, I wish I had hit him-nothing too seri-
ous-just enough to shut him up for even a second.
</p>
<p>
"Well, enjoy your day, Paulie." I return my attention to the pas-
try display case, pretending I still haven't made up my mind as to
what I'm ordering.
</p>
<p>
Paulie doesn't seem to notice or care.
"So where are you off to?"
"I'm going to the shop."
"You're open today? Sposa Rosa's never been open on a Sun-
day. Are you losing money?"
</p>
<p>
I picture myself on my childhood bike, hitting him head on-
again and again.
</p>
<p>
"No, business has actually never been better, especially after the
feature Brides magazine did on us a few months ago. I have to fin-
ish my wedding dress, and with the store being as busy as it is, the
only time I get to work on it is late at night or on Sundays."
</p>
<p>
"Of course! Of course!" Paulie slaps his forehead. "How could
I forget? Our little Valentina is finally getting married. You know I
was beginning to get a little worried for you."
</p>
<p>
Oh, how I wish I were on that bike right now-no, make that a
car instead.
</p>
<p>
"Paulie!" I laugh through gritted teeth. "I'm not the only
woman in New York to have waited to get engaged until she was in
her thirties!"
</p>
<p>
"I know. I know. But I just couldn't understand why no one had
snagged you sooner. You're such a pretty girl with a good head on
your shoulders."
</p>
<p>
Apparently, Paulie's definition of shoulders is different from
mine since his eyes rest on my breasts. I forgot to mention that
Paulie is also a perv. He rarely misses a chance to ogle a woman's
boobs.
</p>
<p>
"I was just picky. There aren't enough good men out there."
"May I take your order, miss?"
The salesgirl saves me.
"It was nice talking to you, Paulie. 'Bye!"
</p>
<p>
I place my order for Palline di Limone biscotti and even throw in
a few assorted mini Danish so I can talk to her longer, hoping
Paulie will leave me alone.
</p>
<p>
" 'Bye, Valentina."
It works! Paulie walks away.
"Hey, Valentina!" He stops, returning to my side.
"Have I told you I can't wait to spin you around the dance floor
at your wedding? Oh, wait! You're getting married in Venice.
That's too far. I won't be there."
</p>
<p>
Thank you, God, Mary, and all the blessed saints in heaven! I
nod sadly, belying my true thoughts of elation. Then I look down
into my purse as I search for my wallet. I know I'm being rude, but
I don't care. Paulie has been rude toward my family countless
times. He finally leaves the bakery, picking up one of the compli-
mentary toothpicks on the counter.
</p>
<p>
I breathe a sigh of relief. Choosing to get married in Venice was
the best decision I ever made. I put Paulie as far away from my
thoughts as possible, and focus on returning to the meditative,
blissful state I was in before I ran into him.
</p>
<p>
After leaving the bakery, I pass Anthony's Salumeria. My mouth
waters as I spot Anthony slicing prosciutto-my favorite Italian
cold cut. Unable to resist, I walk into the deli and order half a
pound of the salty meat along with a block of sharp provolone.
</p>
<p>
"Good morning, Valentina!"
"Hi, Anthony! How are you?"
</p>
<p>
"Can't complain. I'll be out of here by noon. The Giants are
playing so I've got that to look forward to."
</p>
<p>
Anthony always gives me the first slice of meat to sample even
though I know he carries nothing but the freshest products.
</p>
<p>
"Hmmm! Still the best!"
</p>
<p>
Anthony smiles. Sometimes, I think he goes through this ritual
more for his own sake than mine. He just can't resist hearing his
cold cuts praised.
</p>
<p>
Although I am used to the sights and sounds of the neighbor-
hood that has been my home since I was a child, they seem more vi-
brant today. The bread at Antoniella's Bakery smells particularly
heavenly. The froth threatening to spill over from the patrons' cap-
puccinos looks thicker, and the prosciutto at Anthony's is the sweet-
est ever. Even my three-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement
ring sparkles brighter today.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it's the start of a new year, and finally I feel like this is going
to be my year. After designing and sewing wedding dresses for
other lucky brides-to-be for so long, it will now be my turn to shine
in the spotlight. In just five months, on June 14th to be precise, I'll
be marrying Michael Carello in my favorite city in the world-
Venice.
</p>
<p>
I had secretly admired Michael since I was ten years old.
Michael was thirteen, but even though he was three years older
than me, he always said hi and tried to make me laugh. Popular at
school and in our neighborhood, Michael and his family lived
around the block from me, so I often saw him playing football or
hockey with his friends on my street.
</p>
<p>
He has blond hair and blue eyes, defying the dark southern Ital-
ian stereotype. He takes after his mother. Iva Carello is beautiful
even now that she's in her late fifties and is often told she resembles
the deceased Princess Grace of Monaco in her twilight years. His
father, Joseph Carello, also poses a striking figure, with intense
black eyes and a full head of hair at sixty. He always wears a suit,
and on his days off from work, he still wears trousers with a button-
down shirt, minus the tie and jacket.
</p>
<p>
Michael has definitely inherited his parents' sense of style. Even 
as a kid when he wore jeans or got dirty playing sports, he always
looked good. It's hard not to notice Michael. But what really
branded my devotion to him was when he had come to my defense
at Li's Grocery Store when I was a kid.
</p>
<p>
I passed Li's Grocery Store every day on my way to school. My
mother sometimes bought a few groceries there. It wasn't a real
supermarket in the sense that you could get your week's worth of
shopping. Mr. Li, a Taiwanese immigrant, owned the store and
never had a smile for his patrons. Maybe that, along with its limited
stock, was why hardly anyone frequented the store. But Li's did
have an aisle full of cool school supplies like pretty binders with
flower or fairy patterns, spiral notebooks with sparkly glitter cov-
ers, Hello Kitty pencil cases, and my favorite-Strawberry Short-
cake erasers that smelled like strawberries, of course.
</p>
<p>
Every afternoon when I walked home from school for lunch, I
would stop by Mr. Li's to eye the stationery I couldn't afford. I al-
ways politely greeted Mr. Li, who acknowledged me even if it was
just a stern "Hello." So I was shocked when one day he yelled at me
as I was leaving the store.
</p>
<p>
"You! Yes, I talk to you. What you have in pocket?"
I froze as if he had a gun cocked right at my head.
"I say what in pocket? Take hand out."
</p>
<p>
I took my hands out of my powder-blue, faux-fur-trimmed coat,
holding my palms up to show him they were empty as I whispered,
"Nothing."
</p>
<p>
"You come every day. No buy anyteeng. Why?"
"I was just looking."
</p>
<p>
My heart was beating as fast as my cat Gigi's after my mother
had thrown her heavy clog at him for stealing food off our table
when we weren't looking.
</p>
<p>
"Hey! Leave her alone! She didn't take anything!"
I hadn't even seen Michael and his best friend, Sal, standing at
the register. Utter humiliation washed over me as my face flushed,
resembling the color of the half-rotten pomegranates that lay in the
boxes at the front of the store.
</p>
<p>
"She here every day. Hide in back. Teenk I no see. I no idi-uht.
She never buy anyteeng. She steal."
</p>
<p>
Bella Fortuna . 7
</p>
<p>
"I know her. She would never steal a penny. It's a free country.
She can come in here and look without buying anything. Just because
she doesn't buy your crummy stuff doesn't mean she's stealing."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Li frowned and glanced at me again. I lowered my eyes to
the floor.
</p>
<p>
"It's okay, Valentina. Come on, let's get out of here."
Michael placed his arm around my shoulders, leading me out. I
could feel Mr. Li's gaze burning a hole through the back of my head
as if he was trying to read my mind, still questioning if I'd somehow
stolen something and had cleverly hidden it.
</p>
<p>
Once outside, Michael turned to Sal. "Give us a minute. I'll
catch up with you in a second." Sal nodded his head and walked
toward school.
</p>
<p>
Michael removed his arm from my shoulder and bent his head
lower so his eyes met mine. I stared at the ground, wishing I could
shrink to the size of the ants that were crawling around the broken
pieces of bread that someone had thrown to the pigeons.
</p>
<p>
"Are you okay?"
I nodded my head. "Thanks," I managed to mutter in a tiny
voice.
</p>
<p>
Michael patted my arm. "Don't feel bad. You hear me? You
didn't do anything wrong. You're a good girl, Valentina. Mr. Li's a
stingy jerk. He once wouldn't let an old lady who was short a quar-
ter walk out of there with a loaf of bread. I gave him the quarter.
What a creep."
</p>
<p>
I just nodded my head again and continued to look down at the
cracks in the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I gotta get back to school. My lunch break is almost over.
But if you want, I'll walk you home."
I shook my head. "No. That's okay. Thank you."
"Don't sweat it!"
I turned and began walking home.
"Hey, Valentina!"
I stopped and looked over my shoulder, still not meeting
Michael's worried gaze.
"If anyone ever treats you like that again, just tell me. I'll take
care of them for you."
</p>
<p>
I finally managed to smile at him. He winked at me and then
turned around, running to catch up with Sal.
</p>
<p>
That wink was all it took to make me fall completely in love with
Michael. After that day, every time I saw Michael he always winked
at me after he said hello. It was as if he knew its power. For with
that one wink, I felt myself soar high above the sky, dancing in
midair with the birds. Now my childhood fantasies of wedding my
prince someday were replaced with dreams of marrying Michael.
</p>
<p>
And that was how my crush on Michael began. But I had to
watch helplessly over the years as he dated one girl after another.
When I turned fourteen and puberty finally decided to pay me a
visit, filling in my flat chest and narrow hips, Michael still seemed to
look at me as if I were that ten-year-old kid whom he'd rescued. I'd
noticed his friends staring at me a few times when they thought I
wasn't looking, but not Michael. Unlike his friends, his gaze always
met mine rather than my boobs, which were already a C-cup at that
point. But something had changed in how he treated me. He no
longer winked at me after he said hello. In fact, he didn't even try to
make me laugh, as he'd loved to do when I was younger. I didn't
get it.
</p>
<p>
So I started dating, having one miserable relationship after an-
other or not having a boyfriend when important occasions arose
like a friend's Sweet Sixteen party or my sophomore-year dance.
My best friend, Aldo, had gone with me to the dance. I could al-
ways count on Aldo when I needed a date. So I'd put on my best
poker face and pretended I was having a blast with him when all I
could think about was, Why can't I have a boyfriend for longer than
two months? Why can't I have a boyfriend here with me instead of
my best friend?
</p>
<p>
Of course, Michael still wound his way into my thoughts, but
not as much since he'd left for Cornell University. I only saw him
when he came home for breaks. I was beginning to accept the fact
that he'd never have any interest in me as anything more than a
childhood friend. I was the little sister he never had, nothing more.
Yet from time to time, my mind still wandered to him, wondering
what he was doing.
</p>
<p>
"Swaying room as the music starts . . . strangers making the most
of the dark."
Madonna's "Crazy for You" was playing. I loved this song. I felt
a hand on my shoulder and turned around.
"Wanna dance?"
Michael!
"Hey! What are you doing here?"
"I heard the music from outside. I couldn't resist coming in and
catching up with some old friends and teachers."
"They let you in?"
"Of course! Why not?" He winked at me.
Oh my God! He hadn't winked at me in years. It still had the
same bone-melting effect on me.
</p>
<p>
"Come on. Let's dance." Michael took my hand, leading me to
the dance floor. My heart was racing so fast, I was convinced he
could see it. He pulled me close to him as we slowly danced to the
music. He rested his chin on my shoulder. I swallowed hard. I
should probably make some conversation. But all I wanted to do
was close my eyes and listen to the words of Madonna's "Crazy for
You."
</p>
<p>
"Isn't this such a great song?" Michael pulled his head back and
looked into my eyes, smiling.
"You like this song, too?" I asked incredulously.
"Yeah, it's one of my all-time eighties favorites, right up there
with The Cure's 'Just Like Heaven.' "
"Oh my God! I love that song!"
"No way!"
"Yeah, way!"
</p>
<p>
We laughed together. He put his chin back on my shoulder.
Again, my insecurities were telling me I should make more of an
attempt at conversation. Why couldn't I just relax and enjoy this
moment? It would probably never happen again.
</p>
<p>
"So how's Cornell?" I managed to get out.
"Stuffy and dull!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, come on! I can't believe it's all that dull! I can only imag-
ine all the fun you must be having at those parties and all those in-
teresting classes. I can't wait to go away to college."
</p>
<p>
"Really?"
"What's so surprising about that? You think I want to stay in
Astoria and commute to school? Get real!"
"I don't know. I just thought you'd be like the other Italian girls
in the neighborhood and stick close to home. Besides, will your
parents let you go away for college?"
"Probably not, but I don't care. I'm going to do it anyway!"
</p>
<p>
Michael laughed. "You've got spunk! I like that. You are differ-
ent from a lot of the girls around the neighborhood. Promise me
you'll stay that way." Michael pulled his face away and stared into
my eyes again, waiting for my promise.
</p>
<p>
I shrugged my shoulders.
"Promise me!"
His face came closer to mine. My heart started pounding again.
"Okay." I blushed and looked away. He was staring at me in the
most peculiar way.
</p>
<p>
"Good!" He winked at me again and pulled me close to him. I
could smell his cologne. Drakkar Noir. Every guy wore Drakkar
Noir back then. It just occurred to me that Michael wasn't dressed
for a dance. After all, he wasn't planning on coming. I didn't care.
He was the sexiest guy here tonight. His dark-wash denim jeans
and black V-neck sweater made him look like one of those male
models I'd seen on the covers of Maxim magazine or GQ.
</p>
<p>
"So you like The Cure, huh?"
"Yeah, they're one of my favorite eighties bands."
"I might be able to score some tickets to one of their concerts at
the Meadowlands this summer. Would you be interested?"
I looked up into Michael's eyes.
"You know. For you and a friend."
"Oh. Sure. That would be nice." Just as soon as my hopes had
soared, they immediately took a nosedive.
The song was over. We looked at each other a bit uncertainly.
"Thanks for the dance," I said.
</p>
<p>
"Hey! No sweat. I'll let you know about the tickets when I'm
back in town for the summer. They're supposed to go on sale next
Monday, but there's someone at school who scalps them. He said
he'd hook me up."
</p>
<p>
"Okay. Sounds good. Thanks."
"I'll catch you later. I want to say hi to Mr. C."
"Sure. Go ahead." Boy, I sounded lame! Like he needed my
permission to leave.
Michael smiled and looked at me as if he wanted to say some-
thing else. Then he walked away.
</p>
<p>
I made my way to the refreshments table and asked for a Coke.
My mouth felt so dry, and my hands still felt shaky. Part of me was
elated that Michael had asked me to dance, but another part was
disappointed, too. For a second, I thought he was going to ask me
to go to The Cure concert with him.
</p>
<p>
"Hey, Vee! You guys looked amazing! Give me all the juicy de-
tails!"
"There are no details to give, Aldo."
</p>
<p>
I crossed my arms and searched the room for Michael. Mr. C.,
the American History teacher at St. John's Prep, was talking to Ms.
Vicelli, my English Literature teacher. It looked like Mr. C. was
flirting with her, touching her shoulder regularly as he talked ani-
matedly with his hands. He must be bragging about something. Mr.
C. often told the most outlandish stories from his days when he was
young, as he liked to put it. I couldn't help feeling he had chosen
the wrong career path. He loved attention and should've gone into
politics or acting. Ms. Vicelli was pretty with light golden brown
hair and highlights that framed just her front bangs. It seemed like
every male teacher at St. John's Prep was in love with her. She was
one of the nicest teachers at school.
</p>
<p>
Michael approached them and shook Mr. C.'s hand. Ms. Vicelli
gave him a hug. Suddenly, I felt jealous. I knew it was crazy to be
jealous of Ms. Vicelli. She was, what? A dozen years older than
Michael? But still. I wanted it to be me hugging him, not her.
</p>
<p>
Aldo broke in on my thoughts.
"I saw the way Michael was holding you while you guys danced.
And the look on his face! He has the hots for you big-time! Trust
your big bro Aldo. He always knows best."
"Well, you couldn't be farther from the truth."
"Aldo's eyes and instincts have never failed him!"
</p>
<p>
"Okay, I admit. I thought I was getting a few vibes from him, es-
pecially a couple of times when he looked at me extra long."
"I knew it!"
"Control yourself! There's nothing to it. We talked a little about
music, and he's also an eighties music nut like we are."
"This is getting better and better. And the man has good taste!"
I wanted to smack Aldo.
"Well, he told me he might be able to get tickets for The Cure
this summer. He asked me if I was interested."
"Ahhhhh!!!!" Aldo grabbed my shoulders and shook me back
and forth. A few people standing near us looked at him and
frowned.
"He then added, 'For you and a friend.' "
"Oh my God! You have to take me! You have to take me! I'll
never talk to you again if you don't." Aldo jumped up and down.
Then he suddenly stopped.
"Wait. This is not good. I'm so sorry."
"I was beginning to wonder how long it would take for your
brain to register what I said."
"Oh, Vee! I'm so sorry. I'm such an idiot. Here you are thinking
Michael is finally going to ask you out on a date, only to have him
say he'll get you a pair of tickets to go with someone else, and I'm
thinking about myself."
"It's okay. I know how much you love Robert Smith. If it were
someone else, I wouldn't have forgiven you." I smiled, letting Aldo
know we were good.
"Vee, I think it's the jail-bait thing. I really do. He's just waiting
for you to turn eighteen, and once you do, he's going to ask you
out. I'm sure of it."
Michael was now eighteen years old compared to my fifteen,
hence, the jail-bait issue.
"I wish I could share your optimism, Aldo. But I'm too realistic.
You're also forgetting that he was dating Danielle Santucci in the
fall. She's just seventeen."
"But you're different. He respects you. Danielle has no class.
Everyone knows she lost her virginity when she was in sixth grade,
for crying out loud."
</p>
<p>
"You don't know if that's true. It's just a rumor! And I can't see
Michael dating someone who would have a rep like that."
"I'm sure he heard about it and that's exactly why he dated her."
"He's not like that, Aldo."
"Excuse me, Miss DeLuca. Does Michael have a penis?"
I shook my head.
"No, he doesn't? You are holding out on me. How long have
you been sleeping with him?"
"That's not why I'm shaking my head, and you know it."
I couldn't help laughing at what he'd said.
"Aldo, stop being so sarcastic all the time! You know the closest
I've ever gotten to him is this dance we shared tonight."
"But you do agree that he is a man?"
"This is stupid, Aldo."
"Just humor me, for once, please!"
"I'm always humoring you. I know where you're going with this.
Just because he's a man doesn't mean he thinks like every other
man out there."
"Vee, you're being naive. I know Michael is a nice guy, but a guy
nonetheless. Men can't turn off their sexual needs as easily as
women can."
"Hey, watch it! That sounds sexist. I thought you were on our
side anyway!"
</p>
<p>
"Of course, I'm always on the woman's side. But as you like to
say, 'I'm being realistic.' " Aldo smirked. "I just think you're placing
Michael on this high pedestal that no human-man or woman-
could ever live up to. He's going to fall off it if you expect so much
from him and keep thinking he's perfect."
</p>
<p>
"I know he's not perfect."
"Right." Aldo grabbed a lemon from the cups that were on the
refreshment table next to the iced tea. He sucked on the lemon
wedge, scrunching up his face. Aldo loved lemons and ate them all
the time. One concoction he was especially fond of was cutting a
lemon into wedges and then sprinkling lots of salt, olive oil, and
vinegar over them.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, the rush this gives me!" he'd say with a scrunched-up face,
reveling in the salty and sour taste of the wedges.
</p>
<p>
It was a Sicilian dish that I'd seen my mother prepare many
times. But after trying it once as a kid, I rinsed my mouth out under
the kitchen faucet for almost half an hour to rid myself of the sour
taste.
</p>
<p>
"Enough about Michael." I wanted to change the subject and
fast.
</p>
<p>
"All I was trying to say, Vee, is that he respects you, and that's
probably why he won't date you now while you're jail bait. I've
seen the way he looks at you, and not just tonight. He's been look-
ing at you that way ever since your curves paid you a visit."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I've never seen him look at me below my eyes."
"Of course not. He's too smart. He's not like those blockheads
he hangs out with who make it so obvious. Geez! You'd think they
were starving or something. I've caught him looking at you when
your back was turned, and he thought no one was looking. But I
see everything! That's my job. I'm your spy."
</p>
<p>
I laughed. "Aldo, you're too much!"
"I'm just looking out for my girl."
"And I love you for it!" I hugged Aldo. "I see what you're trying
to do. But you don't have to make me feel better."
"Are you implying that I'm lying? You know I'd never do that
to you."
"No, I'm not saying that. But maybe, like me, you're seeing
something you want to see or hope to see because you care about
me so much. That's all."
"Look, Vee. I would tell you if I thought you were wasting your
time chasing this particular tail."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't help laughing silently. No matter how many times I'd
told Aldo that "chasing tail" was what one said when referring to
girls, he still insisted on using it for girls who chased guys or even
guys who chased guys. Aldo had come out of the closet to his fam-
ily last year. And just as I confided in him about Michael, he told
me about his crushes and whose "tail" he was chasing at the mo-
ment.
</p>
<p>
"I would totally tell you to look for other 'tail' if I thought
Michael wasn't attracted to you. And I'm glad you haven't been sitting around, waiting for when he's ready to ask you out. I can't 
stand anything more than girls who are loyal to guys who they just
have crushes on. They're not boyfriend/girlfriend, for crying out
loud! It's insane! Anyway, I really do think there's more to it with
Michael."
</p>
<p>
"We'll see. I'm not holding my breath. I'm not even holding my
breath that he'll remember to get me those Cure tickets."
"So, who are you going to take if he does give you two tickets?"
"Ohhhh, I don't know. I owe my little sister Connie a favor,
and she still hasn't even been to a concert. This would be a treat
for her."
</p>
<p>
Aldo was looking down at the floor. "Oh, sure. I bet."
I kicked his combat boots. He insisted on wearing nothing but
his combats even when he attended formal occasions like this
dance or a wedding. At least, he had worn a suit with a super-thin
tie, harking back to his favorite era of music, the eighties, and the
New Wave bands who had made the look popular. He slicked back
his dark brown, shoulder-length hair. Except for his piercing black
eyes, he could've passed for U2's Bono from their Joshua Tree
album days.
</p>
<p>
"You know I wouldn't dream of taking anyone else to the con-
cert! Why are you even playing this stupid game?"
"Yes! You're the best! I knew you wouldn't let me down! Oh
my God! We're going to see The Cure! The Cure!" He grabbed my
hands and twirled me around.
</p>
<p>
I was excited about the possibility of seeing The Cure in con-
cert, too. But I would've been more thrilled if Michael had asked
me to go with him. I looked toward where he'd been standing ear-
lier with Mr. C. and Ms. Vicelli, but Michael was no longer talking
to them. I searched the room, but couldn't spot him. Maybe he'd
left. I felt my heart sink a little that I wouldn't see him again. I was
secretly hoping he'd ask me for a second dance.
</p>
<p>
Aldo and I hopped into a cab after the dance was over. I lived
within walking distance of school, but Aldo lived on Upper Dit-
mars Boulevard and was too tired to walk all the way back home.
</p>
<p>
The cab let me out at the corner of my street instead of making the
turn, saving Aldo some money in cab fare.
</p>
<p>
" 'Bye, Vee! I'll call you in the morning for brunch."
"Forget it, Aldo! It's almost midnight. I'm not waking up before
noon!"
"That's why it's called brunch! Noon is actually early. Later!"
"Whatever!" I stuck my tongue out at him. He stuck his out,
too. We both laughed. Aldo waved one last time and rolled up the
window as the cab pulled away.
</p>
<p>
Aldo had a way of making me feel good when I needed it. I
knew I hadn't fooled him tonight with my act, and he'd sensed I
was blue.
</p>
<p>
Although my neighborhood was extremely safe and you always
saw people walking late at night on Ditmars, I still decided to walk
fast in my three-inch pumps. My feet were absolutely throbbing
from all the dancing Aldo and I had done. I stopped suddenly. A
couple was leaning against the wall of a driveway, making out. I tip-
toed past them, trying to get closer while stealing a glance. The
light from the street lamp shone on the girl's backside. She was
leaning into the boy, whose back was up against the wall. They were
kissing. The girl was wearing a super-tight mango-colored cocktail
dress, which was bunched up around her waist. The boy's hands
were running up and down the back of her exposed thighs. There
was something familiar about that dress. I looked away and kept
walking when it hit me where I'd seen that dress. Tracy was wear-
ing it at the dance! How could I forget? Every guy's head was spin-
ning in her direction. Her dress pushed her cleavage way out of its
bodice, and every curve in her butt showed. I was afraid the seam
on the back was going to burst open.
</p>
<p>
Though Tracy Santana was my best friend since grade school,
we were very different. Unlike me, school didn't come easily for
Tracy. She tried very hard and studied, but the best grade her ef-
forts produced was a C. Her mother hit her with a belt when she
brought home poor grades. She often showed me and our other
friends the pink welts that stood out on her paper-white skin. Her
super-straight, thick hair was jet black and hung down to her hips.
</p>
<p>
Tracy's mother was always on her case about cutting her hair short,
whereas my mother encouraged me to keep mine long.
</p>
<p>
With her very fair complexion and raven-colored hair, Tracy re-
minded me of Snow White. But instead of having an evil step-
mother, Tracy's own mother was the witch. My parents, on the
other hand, never laid a hand on me. Sometimes, I felt as if Tracy
envied me for my good grades and for having parents who didn't
punish me with a belt.
</p>
<p>
We became best friends when we were in first grade. After that,
we spoke every night on the phone, sometimes for as long as two
hours. She only called me after her mother left for her night job and
after Tracy had prepared dinner for her father and brother. I
cringed when I called her house and her mother answered.
</p>
<p>
Now that we were in high school, the differences only seemed to
be growing between us. She had no problem showing off her figure
to the point where she might as well have been walking around in
her underwear. I didn't mind looking sexy, but I also believed in
the old adage, "Leave something to the imagination."
</p>
<p>
Tracy wasn't as afraid of her mother anymore and seemed to
rebel more with each passing day. She flirted heavily with the boys,
whereas my shyness prevented me from even talking to the boys
unless they approached me first. Tracy was a size zero and wore a
super-padded bra to amplify her A-cup breasts. Her green eyes,
which stood out in stark contrast to her dark hair, were her best
feature. And Tracy used them to full advantage when talking to
boys, squinting her gaze to give herself an extra sexy allure. I'd seen
the less-confident boys quickly look away when she stared at them,
but the more cocky guys stared back, looking completely mesmerized.
</p>
<p>
Tracy was more outgoing than I was. Her good sense of humor
attracted everyone to her, but her lies always caught up with her
and would eventually alienate all the friends she'd made. Through-
out grade school, she often lied to mutual friends of ours and told
them I'd said things about them when I hadn't. I always forgave
her. I don't know why, I just did.
</p>
<p>
A stray cat darted into my line of vision, bringing me back to the
present. Who was Tracy kissing? Amazingly, she didn't have a 
boyfriend at the moment either. It seemed that she went from guy
to guy within a day after one relationship ended. It was as if the
boys were on a waiting list to date her. Tracy's last boyfriend had
broken up with her just three days before the dance. But this time,
she bravely chose to go alone. You wouldn't have known it, though,
since she'd managed to find a guy to dance with her to almost every
song.
</p>
<p>
My curiosity was getting the better of me. I knew I shouldn't be
snooping, but I had to see who was with her. I quietly walked up
the front steps of the house whose driveway they were in. I
crouched down behind a rosebush, hoping it would be enough to
conceal me. Suddenly, the guy spun Tracy around so that her
back was now up against the driveway's wall. The light shone on
his profile.
</p>
<p>
Michael!
</p>
<p>
My hand flew to my mouth as I gasped. Luckily for me, they
were too caught up in themselves to have heard me. No! Not my
Michael. It was dark. I must not be seeing right. I stood up higher
to get a better look. It was definitely Michael. He removed his
mouth from Tracy's and began kissing her neck. At this point, I was
standing to my full height, forgetting that I wasn't concealed any-
more. I just kept staring at Michael. Aldo was right! He was acting
just like every other guy would. I felt so stupid. Tears stung my eyes
as they spilled down onto my face. I finally glanced over at Tracy,
and my heart stopped. Her eyes met mine dead-on. Her lips turned
up into the most wicked smile. She then lowered her head and
kissed Michael. Her eyes shot open again while she was kissing
him, staring right at me. I turned my head away and ran down the
steps, not caring if Michael heard me. If he did, he didn't care,
since I didn't hear my name and no one was chasing me.
</p>
<p>
How could she? She knew how I felt about Michael. Besides
Aldo, she was the only other person I'd confided in about my crush
on Michael. She'd listened to me tell her how I hoped, some day in
the future, we'd end up together. She had sympathized with me
and even told me, "Don't worry, Vee. He'll be yours someday. He
just needs to sow his wild oats before he comes to you."
</p>
<p>
Apparently, she was helping him sow those oats.
</p>
<p>
I ran as fast as I could down the block to my house. All I could
think of was Tracy's twisted little smile as she stared at me. She
looked happy that I'd caught them. She didn't care that she'd just
stuck a knife right into my heart. I could feel the pain pressing
against my chest. I couldn't stop crying. Why would my best friend
do this to me? How could she?
</p>
<p>
I got to my house. My mother was probably waiting up for me.
I searched frantically in my purse for a tissue. Not finding one, I
wiped my eyes with the back of my hands. I unlocked the door.
There was a box of tissues on the foyer table. Pulling a few out, I
patted my eyes. My reflection stared back at me in the hallway mir-
ror. Pools of mascara swirled around my red eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Valentina! Tu sei?"
"Si, Ma."
I ran into the bathroom down the hall, just as my mother en-
tered the hallway.
"Sta bene?"
Behind the bathroom door, the tears started racing down my
face again. I knew if I answered right away, she'd hear the sobs.
"Valentina? You okay?"
I flushed the toilet, trying to buy some more time. I quickly
swallowed and turned on the sink.
"Yeah, Ma. I'm okay. Just had to use the bathroom really bad."
"You have a good time?"
</p>
<p>
Ugghhhh!!! No matter how many times I told my mother I
couldn't hear her well while I was in the bathroom with the water
running, she always continued to have a conversation with me.
</p>
<p>
"Yeah, it was nice. I'll tell you about it in the morning. I'm going
to get ready for bed. I'm really tired. Did Baba go to sleep al-
ready?"
</p>
<p>
"Si, si. He knew you were in good hands with Aldo. I did, too,
but you know me. I still worry when one of you girls is out late.
Ahhh! Va bene. Buona notte, fighita!"
</p>
<p>
Fighita had been my mother's endearment for me since I was a
kid. It meant "dear one" or "sweet one." I started crying even
more.
</p>
<p>
I washed my face with cold water. Making sure my mother really 
had gone up to bed, I listened behind the bathroom door. Deathly
still. I cracked the door open an inch. Only the nightlight was on
near the stairs leading to our bedrooms. I took the stairs two at a
time, which was hard to do in my snug dress, though not as snug as
that tramp's who was kissing the love of my life. As I passed my
parents' bedroom, light streamed from underneath their door. I
could hear Ma's low whispers as she prayed. Pausing for a moment
behind her door, I tried to hear what she was praying about but was
unable to. I began to raise my hand to knock but dropped my hand
back to my side and tiptoed to my room. No matter how much I
wanted her to help me feel better, I just couldn't bear to see the
hurt in her eyes when she'd see how pained I was. Besides, she didn't
know about my feelings for Michael.
</p>
<p>
I took off my dress. When I had put it on earlier in the night, I
was so proud of it. My mother had made it for me. It was a deep
emerald green with black tulle and lace trim throughout the dress.
It had a square neckline with a V-cut in the center, giving a tiny
peek to my cleavage. I had worn one of my minimizer bras out of
fear of showing off too much cleavage.
</p>
<p>
When my sister Rita saw me, she said, "What a shame to hide
those magnificent tits!" I scowled at her. You'd think she was years
older than me and more experienced, the way she talked.
</p>
<p>
Before taking off my dress, I stared at myself in the full-length
mirror that hung on my closet door and remembered how earlier in
the night I'd wished that somehow Michael could've seen me in it.
My wish was granted when he showed up at the dance. But my
hopes that the sight of me in this dress was all it would take to con-
vince him I wasn't a little girl anymore were crushed-first with his
mention of getting the concert tickets for a friend and me, and then
seeing him making out with my girlfriend, who was quickly becom-
ing the town tramp.
</p>
<p>
I threw the dress onto the floor. Stupid! How stupid could I
have been? Aldo had nailed it exactly when he said that I saw
Michael as this perfect guy and above the lousy frat-boy behavior
his peers often exhibited. What did I know about him anyway?
Not much. I was basing my knowledge of Michael's worth just
from that day he'd saved me at Li's Grocery Store. I was still that 
same kid looking up to her idol, who could do no wrong in her
eyes.
</p>
<p>
I sank into bed with a heavy weariness. Pulling the sheets close
to my chin, I promised myself that night I would forget Michael
Carello once and for all. But keeping that promise would prove to
be much more difficult than I ever could've imagined. For over the
summer, my world was about to shatter. And Michael would prove
to be my knight in shining armor once again.
</p>
<p>
The snow that is now falling shakes me back to the present. I
fight back the memories from that summer and take a deep breath
of cold air, letting it cleanse my lungs and spirits. I quicken my
steps along Ditmars Boulevard.
</p>
<p>
New York City is having a record amount of snowfall this win-
ter. We've had three major snowstorms already, and it's only mid-
January. February often packs the biggest wallop of the season
where the cold and snow are involved.
</p>
<p>
The pink sign of Sposa Rosa soon comes into view as I round
the corner of Ditmars and 38th Street. I can still feel that thorn
pricking my side whenever I look at the shop's name. Leave it to my
mother to choose "pink bride" as the name of the bridal boutique
that she'd opened ten years ago. I still remember the battle I had
with my mother as if it were yesterday.
</p>
<p>
"But, Ma, hardly any bride wears pink unless you've been mar-
ried five times, and even then some people still prefer to wear
white!"
</p>
<p>
"Basta, Valentina! The name is going to be Sposa Rosa, and
that's that. It's memorable. It rhymes. And it's different. When I
die, you can call it "Always White" or some other unoriginal, bor-
ing name. But right now this is Olivia DeLuca's shop, so the name
stays. Finito!"
</p>
<p>
My sisters Rita and Connie giggled in the background. They
knew Ma was teasing my traditional tastes. When we were kids,
Rita had nicknamed me "Plain Jane." I guess I couldn't blame her.
I ate my pancakes without maple syrup and my hot dogs and burg-
ers without ketchup or mustard. I liked more classic styles when it
came to my clothes. But that didn't mean I always chose to be conservative. My mother and sisters were in for a shock later today
when I would unveil my wedding dress to them.
</p>
<p>
Sposa Rosa was famous for copying couture designer dresses
but offering the dresses at a significantly reduced rate. As I was
telling Paulie Parlatone, Brides magazine recently did a story on
our-I mean, Ma's boutique. Although the shop was in Ma's name,
we all thought of it as ours, and we knew it would be our mother's
legacy to us after she died. Anyway, the article in Brides mentioned
the store's custom of featuring a different couture designer dress
every month. Brides had also paid us the highest compliment by
stating, "Attention to detail is flawless, and the dresses are made so
well that even the designer might not be able to tell which is the
original and which is the knockoff."
</p>
<p>
Ever since the article was published, more customers were
swinging through Sposa Rosa's doors. We were all thrilled even
though we were exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around.
</p>
<p>
With fewer than six months to go until my wedding, I'd been
fretting over completing my dress. After all, everyone knows the
dress is the most important detail of the wedding. With the shop
being so busy, it was hard to devote more time to my dress and
overall wedding planning. My family helped any way they could,
but I admit it, I was guilty of wanting to micromanage my wedding.
</p>
<p>
I'll also be the first to acknowledge that I can be guilty of a few
Bridezilla moments, but my temper tantrums have been mild com-
pared to some of Sposa Rosa's clients. From witnessing so many
monsters, I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would
never resort to being one when it was my turn to get married. It's
been annoying having to put Sposa Rosa's clients' dresses before
my own, especially when it's for a Bridezilla. But this is my career
and passion; it comes with the territory. Whenever I remember
how lucky I am to have the skills to be able to design and sew my
own wedding dress-the dress of my dreams that no one else will
have-my frustration lifts. And today, I would finally have my first
fitting!
</p>
<p>
I decided to model my wedding dress after one of our featured
dresses of the month from last spring. It was an Amy Michelson de-
sign that sported a lace bodice and halter neckline. One of my favorite features of the dress was its plunging back. A champagne-colored sash wrapped around the waist and tied into a loose bow
just above my derriere. But I put my own mark on the gown by
adding pearl beads to the lace-covered bodice. Another twist was
the detachable organza skirt that gave the appearance of a full ball
gown skirt, but once removed, the dress was transformed into a
body-hugging, sexy sheath with a daring shorter hem that fell just
below the knee. The shorter front hem of the dress was visible even
when the detachable organza skirt was attached to the gown. But
no one would be able to detect there were two separate pieces. The
skirt of the dress was bare and did not feature any of the lace or
beading that was on the bodice.
</p>
<p>
The suspense of showing the dress to my mother and sisters was
giving me heart palpitations. I just couldn't wait to see their faces.
They knew I had chosen the Amy Michelson design, but they had
no idea I'd altered it. Although beautiful in its original, more sim-
ple design, the Amy Michelson dress was now a bold gown that
screamed, "Look at me!" I didn't want a dress that so many others
would have. I wanted my own unique dress.
</p>
<p>
The thought of the dress makes me even more anxious to get to
the shop. Arriving finally at Sposa Rosa, I unlock the doors and
turn on the lights. Even after being in business for ten years, I am
still in awe every time I walk in. Ask any girl, and she'll tell you
there's something magical about a bridal boutique. It all starts with
the glittering, beautiful dresses in the storefront window, which
catch your eye and lure you to step inside. Then there's the excite-
ment in the air when customers are trying on their dresses, and
teary-eyed family and friends are looking at the bride-to-be as if
she's the Madonna. Okay, I know that's a stretch for our times, but
you know what I mean.
</p>
<p>
The marble floors, imported straight from Italy, shine immacu-
lately. My mother mops them every night before we lock the store.
The walls are shades of celestial blue and creamy eggshell. Sketches
of our bridal designs hang on the walls, along with black-and-white
photographs of brides, some of whom have bought their dresses
over the years at Sposa Rosa.
</p>
<p>
My youngest sister, Connie, always makes sure to light scented 
candles when she arrives in the morning. "Ambience is key to sell-
ing," is one of her favorite quotes. Connie is a New Age guru. She
does yoga every morning at the crack of dawn, meditates before she
goes to bed every night, and has recently become vegetarian-a
fact that drives Ma absolutely insane since she can't understand
how anyone would give up her ragu, bracciole on skewers, or her fa-
mous sausage and peppers.
</p>
<p>
Connie had fought with us over adding bubbling fountains with
rocks. But she was right. Several clients commented how much
they liked them and how they added to the Zen-like atmosphere
of the shop. Connie had downloaded her favorite New Age tunes
onto a CD to play at Sposa Rosa. Of course, the irony didn't escape
any of us that we were aiming for serenity in a place that was fraught
with loads of tension!
</p>
<p>
My job can be very rewarding, especially when I see the light
flash in a customer's eyes that this dress is "the one." Almost al-
ways, the girls look to me as if to say, "How did you know?" Of
course, it makes me feel special. And we're all good at being able to
tell which is the right dress for most of our clients. My mother and
sisters have begun recently taking bets on how long it'll take them
to find the dress that the brides will say is "the one." Of course, my
mother with her seasoned skills beats us all. But last week, one of
my clients chose the first design I'd sketched. She didn't even want
to look at the samples of dresses we'd created for other brides in
the past or our portfolio. She wanted a custom dress that did not
look like any of the other designers' dresses that were currently on
the market. A bride being satisfied with the first sketch we design
never happens!
</p>
<p>
My mother was miffed about it. I'm sure she was scared I would
usurp her place. Connie comes third at finding the right gown for
clients. Rita takes being last in stride, saying, "What's important is
that I find the right dress for our client even if it takes a little longer.
After all, we don't want them walking out of here without leaving a
deposit."
</p>
<p>
Making my way to the back of the store, I place my cold cuts in
the refrigerator we keep in the kitchen where we take our lunches
and breaks. I leave the boxes with the Danish and biscotti on the 
square wooden table, which has been passed down the generations
dating back to my great-grandmother. Then, I walk over to the alterations room. Taking the muslin off a mannequin, I stare at my
dream come true-my perfect wedding dress. Tears come into my
eyes. I still can't believe that after ten years of making gowns for
other brides-to-be, I'm finally the lucky girl.
</p>
<p>
With the wedding date fast approaching, I'm also anxious to
finish the dress because I've been neglecting Michael. But after
today, I can relax a bit and see Michael twice a week and the entire
weekend, just as we'd been doing before I began working on my
dress. Of course, Michael has been understanding, especially since
he's had to work late himself.
</p>
<p>
To make it up to me, Michael surprised me last night by taking
me to Water's Edge, a four-star restaurant in Long Island City with
stunning views of Manhattan. Ever since I'd first heard of Water's
Edge in high school, I had fantasized about going there with some-
one special. As we dined and watched the lights around New York
City go on one by one, I couldn't help thinking how serene the
whole night was. There was never any doubt in my mind of
Michael's love as he continually looked into my eyes.
</p>
<p>
"How do you do it?"
"Do what?"
"How do you always manage to look like a star? No matter what
you're wearing-a dress or jeans-there's a certain glamour about
you."
I could feel my cheeks warming up. "Oh, Michael. You're too
good to me."
</p>
<p>
Michael took my hand in his and stroked it. "It's true, Vee. And
you know what makes you more beautiful? You don't even know it.
That's why I love you so much."
"I love you, too, Michael."
After dinner, Michael had a limo waiting for us outside. We
crossed the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan and went to a heli-
port, where we took a helicopter for a spectacular aerial view of the
Big Apple at night. It was the most romantic night.
</p>
<p>
Buzz! Buzzzzzz!
I'm jolted from my thoughts by the sound of Sposa Rosa's 
buzzer, signaling a customer. What's the matter with me today? I
can't stop daydreaming.
"Valentina!"
My mother! I spring into action, quickly draping the muslin
over my gown.
"I'll be right out, Ma!"
</p>
<p>
"When are you going to let your sisters and me see that dress-
the wedding day? You girls are all so secretive nowadays. I remem-
ber in my day a daughter shared everything with her mother."
</p>
<p>
I've heard this lecture countless times. Having grown up poor in
Sicily during World War II, Ma doesn't understand the concept of
privacy. Her feelings are instantly hurt if she discovers that one of
the DeLuca girls has been keeping something from her. Rita had
hidden the fact that she had a boyfriend when she was thirteen.
</p>
<p>
One day, Ma was sitting on a bench in Astoria Park, taking in
the view of the magnificent Manhattan skyline as the sun set over
the East River. She noticed a very young boy and girl standing
by the water and hugging. When the girl turned around and kissed
the boy full on the lips, Ma dropped the vanilla ice cream cone
she'd just bought from Mister Softee right on her lap.
</p>
<p>
"Rita!" she screamed. "Che stai facendo? Disgraziata! Disgrazi-
ata!"
</p>
<p>
Of course, there was no need for Ma to ask Rita what she was
doing. It was plain to everyone at the park. She kept cursing at Rita
until she caught up to her. Rita hadn't even heard Ma until she was
about five feet away from her. Ma grabbed Rita by the arm and
pulled her away. But she stopped after taking two steps and turned
around, looking menacingly at the boy Rita was with.
</p>
<p>
"You come near my daughter again, I kill you!" And then she
made the famous Italian gesture of moving her hand across her
throat as if she were slicing it.
</p>
<p>
On the way home, after Ma lectured Rita about being too young
to have a boyfriend and her famous, "What if the neighbors had
seen you?" line, which was uttered on a weekly basis to one of us,
she said, "How could you have not told me you had a boyfriend?
I'm your mother. You don't keep secrets from your mother."
</p>
<p>
Rita blurted, "Because I knew you'd act like the crazy lady I just
saw in the park."
"Crazy lady, huh? I show you crazy lady. You can't go out with
your friends for a year."
</p>
<p>
Then there was the time Connie got a tattoo of a small angel on
her lower back. That was only a year ago, and though Connie was
in her twenties and shouldn't have been afraid of my mother's dis-
approval, she was. The only time she exposed her tattoo was when
she was out with friends. And if the whole family was at the beach
together, she wore a one-piece bathing suit instead of her usual
teeny string bikinis to hide the tattoo from Ma. But the secret only
lasted six months.
</p>
<p>
Connie had fainted while she was steaming a wedding dress on
what was the hottest day in July last year. Our air conditioner was
on the fritz and though we had fans blowing until the repairman
could come, the heat was stifling. Connie fell face forward, knock-
ing down the enormous tulle ball gown she was steaming. The
dress's super-poofy skirt seemed to swallow whole Connie's petite
figure. At least she had a good buffer to cushion her fall. Her shirt
had ridden up her back, and she was wearing low-waisted jeans.
When Ma ran over to help her, she immediately saw the tattoo. At
first she thought it was a bug on Connie, especially since she'd left
her reading glasses on the sewing machine. She swatted at it. But
when it didn't move, she took a step back to get a better view and
spotted the little angel.
</p>
<p>
"Disgraziata!"
She then turned to me. "Did you know about this?"
My face colored, but I ignored her. "Ma, we have to revive
Connie."
</p>
<p>
We hoisted her up into a chair. Rita ran to the kitchen for vinegar.
Connie came to after getting a whiff of the vinegar. Ma barely gave
her time to recuperate from her fainting spell as she tore into her.
</p>
<p>
"What does the Bible say about marking the body? Eh? Eh?
How many times I tell you and your sisters tattoos are not for
ladies. Only puttanas have tattoos!"
Connie was too disoriented to try and lie. "You saw my angel?"
</p>
<p>
"Si, si. I saw your angel. Stupida! Stupida! You ruin yourself.
What boy is going to want to marry you someday? Eh?"
I tried to defend poor Connie. "Ma, everyone has tattoos now.
They're not just for whores and men. Haven't you noticed all the
tattoo shops opening on Ditmars and Steinway Street? Even movie
stars get them now."
</p>
<p>
"Movie stars, they're one step away from puttanas! On Monday,
I make an appointment to have that tattoo removed from you."
"But, Ma, I'm not a kid anymore! I'm in my twenties, for crying
out loud! You can't make me do something I don't want to do!"
Connie was screaming at the top of her lungs.
"If you don't get that tattoo removed, I am taking your name off
the will."
"Go ahead! I don't care!"
The two of them went at it for another fifteen minutes. Then
Connie stormed out of the shop.
"Secrets. That's all you girls know how to do. What about you,
Valentina? What are you hiding from me?"
"Nothing." I lowered my head.
</p>
<p>
Ma stared at me for what felt like an hour. Then she let out a
long sigh and walked away, whispering to herself in Sicilian and
shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
"Valentina! What is taking you so long to come out?"
My mother's voice snaps me back to the present. I make my way
to the front of the store and kiss her on the cheek.
</p>
<p>
"I have good news, Ma."
"Oh no! You're not pregnant already, are you? With just a few
months to go before the wedding that would be the death of me!"
"I said good news, Ma. Why do you always have to think the
worst?"
"I just like to be prepared for the worst so that when it happens
I'm not so shocked."
"Gloom and doom . . . gloom and doom. I should start calling
you that!"
"Don't be smart with your mother! Remember, I . . ."
". . . know best. I've heard that since forever." I roll my eyes.
"So what's your good news?"
</p>
<p>
"I'll wait until Rita and Connie get here."
"Oh, now you're going to make your mother wait. I'm your
mother. You can tell me first. They'll understand."
</p>
<p>
I bite back a retort. She's right. She does deserve priority. Ma
has been my number one fan and my best friend. True, sometimes
we get into horrible arguments. But no one can take the place of my
mother.
</p>
<p>
"Okay. I'll tell you. But let's keep it a secret between you and
me. I wouldn't want to hurt my sisters' feelings."
Ma smiles. "Si, si. Now, out with it."
"I finished the dress, and I'm ready to show it."
"What are you waiting for? Let me see it!"
"I can't. I know you'll start crying once you see it, and then Rita
and Connie will know something's up."
"Ahhhh!!! You are the death of me. Okay, okay. I'll be patient.
They should be getting here soon anyway. I'll go make some
espresso." She pats my cheek as she walks by. "Have I ever told
you . . ."
". . . I'm a good daughter. Yes, Ma, you have. You're a . . ."
". . . wonderful mama. I know, fighita. I know."
</p>
<p>
She winks at me and begins singing her favorite song,
"Maledetta Primavera," which means "Cursed Spring." Even her
choice in music and movies leans toward the cruel twists of fate life
can have. But that's Olivia DeLuca, and I learned a long time ago
Ma is set in her ways.
