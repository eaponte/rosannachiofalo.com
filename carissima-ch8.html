<p>
Rubies,  sapphires,  emeralds,  diamonds,  pearls . . . I  love  them
all. On the night of the premiere of La Sposa Pazza-my acting
debut-my  director  gave  me  my  first  gift  of  jewelry:  a  stunning
emerald  choker  with  matching  teardrop  emerald  earrings.  They
were the perfect complement to my black taffeta Gucci gown, and
the emeralds brought out the green of my eyes. From that day forward, my long affair with jewels began.
</p>
<p>
Over four decades, I have amassed quite a large collection of
jewelry. And wherever I travel, many of my jewels come also, forcing me to hire an extra bodyguard and take out a hefty insurance
policy for my precious gems. Since I had been unsure of how long
my stay in Astoria would be, I packed most of my jewelry. Though
my days of going to premieres and parties are long over, I like to
wear my jewels even when my plans consist of nothing more than
staying indoors.
</p>
<p>
I am staring at my vast collection, trying to decide which piece
fits  my  mood  for  today  and  matches  my  outfit,  when  there  is  a
knock at the door.
</p>
<p>
Frustrated over being disturbed, I open the door and snap at
the maid.
</p>
<p>
"Si, Angelica?" I ask in a clearly annoyed tone.
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, Signora Donata."
</p>
<p>
"It is Signorina Donata. How many times do I need to remind
you, Angelica?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm sorry, Signorina Donata, but this package arrived for you."
She holds out in the palm of her hand a royal-blue velvet box
that is tied with an elaborate pink satin ribbon. There is no mistaking the contents of the package. I am dumbfounded.
</p>
<p>
"There must be some mistake. This must be for Signora Tesca."
</p>
<p>
"No, no. The messenger said it was for you, Signorina Donata.
There is even an envelope with your name on it." The maid takes
out of her apron pocket an envelope on which my name is written
boldly in script.
</p>
<p>
"Grazie, Angelica."
</p>
<p>
"Prego, Signorina Donata."
</p>
<p>
I nod my head, letting her know that is all and she can take leave
of me. She quickly walks away, her footsteps making no sound in
her rubber-soled maid's shoes. Who could this gift be from? My
heart is racing, as I anticipate what awaits me inside the beautiful
velvet box. I am torn as I pull at the fluffy bow, hating that I must
undo it and ruin the perfect shape. The bow comes apart easily. I
slowly open the lid of the box and gasp. A sapphire and diamond
bangle bracelet greets me. It is one of the most exquisite pieces of
jewelry I have ever laid my eyes on.
</p>
<p>
I waste no time in lifting the bracelet gingerly out of the box and
sliding my wrist through it. Ironically, I am wearing a blue sheath
today that matches the bracelet perfectly. Staring at myself in my
armoire's mirrors, I cannot take my eyes off the glistening jewels.
Ten minutes elapse before I realize I still have no idea who would
give me such a lavish gift. Finally tearing myself away from the armoire, I pick up the envelope and immediately smell a light jasmine
fragrance.  How  thoughtful-and  romantic!  This  is  simply  too
much. Smiling, I feel giddy like a schoolgirl-for it has been ages
since someone has surprised me in such a fashion.
</p>
<p>
Opening the envelope carefully, I pull out a pale green sheet of
stationery. The note is written in elegant cursive similar to the type
that was used for my name on the face of the envelope.
</p>
<p>
"I gioielli perfetti per la donna perfetta."
</p>
<p>
"The perfect jewels for the perfect woman," I read aloud.
</p>
<p>
How lovely! But there is no signature. It must be from one of
my fans-a very wealthy fan. How can I think that this bracelet is
from someone who wants to romance me? I try to ignore the disappointment I feel.
</p>
<p>
"Stupida!" I whisper to myself.
</p>
<p>
I stare at myself once more in the armoire's mirrors, but this
time instead of focusing on the glittering sapphires and diamonds
adorning my wrist, I only see my flaws-the faint but discernible
crow's feet around my eyes, the rings that circle my neck, the slight
hollowing of my cheekbones.
</p>
<p>
"Sei vecchia!"
</p>
<p>
I am too old to be seduced. The gift must be from some obsessed fan who remembers me from before old age paid me a visit.
But still. Someone cares enough to send me such an extravagant
gift. I walk over to my vanity table and pick up the velvet box. On
the inside, underneath its lid, there is just the outline of a diamond,
but in the center-where the jeweler's name would have been imprinted-it is blank. Turning the box over, I inspect its underside,
but there is no indication as to which jewelry store this bracelet
came from.
</p>
<p>
I shrug my shoulders. Jewelry is jewelry, and I'll accept it no
matter what. My spirits have been lifted considerably from receiving new jewels. Though I am happy Giuliana seems to finally want
a relationship with me, my stay here has been quite difficult. She is
very different from the young girl who ran with me through the
sunflower fields behind our house in Sicily. I close my eyes. If only
I could go back and change everything that happened between us.
</p>
<p>
Fighting back the tidal wave of pain threatening to surface, I
twirl my bracelet around my arm. The sapphires glisten darkly, and
the light from the overhead chandelier reflects off the diamonds'
facets. It has been a long six months since I bought any jewels for
myself. Usually, I treat myself every other month.
</p>
<p>
My bedroom door opens a few inches, startling me.
</p>
<p>
"Meow!"
</p>
<p>
"Mewsette! Sei cattiva! Si, si! You are a very, very bad cat. But
that is all right. You just wanted to be with me, vero?" I laugh softly
as Mewsette looks up at me, pleading to be petted.
</p>
<p>
Bending down, I stroke her lustrous white coat. I hold out my
free arm, showing off my new prize.
</p>
<p>
"Ti piaci? E bello, vero?"
</p>
<p>
Mewsette purrs lazily in agreement. She has good taste just like
my secret admirer.
